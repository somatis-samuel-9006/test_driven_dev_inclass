For this in class activity, I wrote a fibonacci function that recursively finds the value of the n'th fibonacci number by calling itself on the values of n-1 and n-2.
I then wrote a factorial function that iteratively finds the factorial of a given number by multiplying every number before and including the number itself with a loop. I
wrote a test suite that covered both of these functions in another file, where I tested it with the unittest and pytest modules. I also tested my suite for 100% statement
coverage in the fibonacci.py file with the coverage module.
